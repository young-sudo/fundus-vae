# Glaucoma Detector using VAE

*by Younginn Park*

This project presents a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implemented in TensorFlow. Originally developed in a **Kaggle notebook**, the model is applied to the **Fundus Glaucoma Detection dataset** to explore unsupervised learning techniques for medical imaging. The project demonstrates the use of VAEs for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and potential glaucoma-related anomaly detection in retinal images.

Originally written in Kaggle notebook for the [Fundus Glaucoma Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sabari50312/fundus-pytorch).
